After many months of ideation, research, and heads-down building, [Fran](https://npub.world/npub1wf4pufsucer5va8g9p0rj5dnhvfeh6d8w0g6eayaep5dhps6rsgs43dgh9) and [myself](https://npub.world/npub176p7sup477k5738qhxx0hk2n0cty2k5je5uvalzvkvwmw4tltmeqw7vgup) are excited to announce our new project called Vertex.

**Vertex's mission is to provide developers and builders with the most up-to-date and easy-to-use Web of Trust tools**.

Our services help customers enhance their user experience by offering:
- Defense against spam and impersonation
- Personalized discovery and recommendations
- Protection from DoS attacks

All in an open, transparent and interoperable way.

## Open and Interoperable

We have structured our services as [NIP-90 Data Vending Machines](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md). We are currently offering [these DVMs](/docs/services/) and we are eager to hear what the community thinks and if anyone has suggestions for improvements.

Regardless of their specific structures, using DVMs means one very important thing: **no vendor lock-in**.

Anyone can start processing the same requests and compete with us to offer the most accurate results at the best price. This is very important for us because we are well aware that services like ours can potentially become a central point of failure. The ease with which we can be replaced by a competitor will keep us on our toes and will continue to motivate us to build better and better experiences for our customers, all while operating in an ethical and open manner.

Speaking of openness, we have released **all of our code under the [MIT license](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)**, which means that anyone can review our algorithms, and any company or power user can run their own copies of Vertex if they so wish.

We are confident in this decision because the value of Vertex is not in the software. It is in the team who designed and implemented it – and now continually improves, manages and runs it to provide the most accurate results with the lowest latency and highest uptime.

## What we offer

We currently support four DVMs, but we plan to increase our offering substantially this year.

1. [`VerifyReputation`](/docs/services/verify-reputation/): give your users useful and personalized information to asses the reputation of an npub, minimizing the risk of impersonations.
2. [`RecommendFollows`](/docs/services/recommend-follows/): give your users personalized recommendations about interesting npubs they might want who to follow.
3. [`SortProfiles`](/docs/services/sort-profiles/): give your users the ability to sort replies, comments, zaps, and just about anything using the authors' reputations.
4. [`SearchProfiles`](/docs/services/search-profiles/): give your users a fast and accurate search experience, without the need of any infrastructure.
